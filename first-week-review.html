</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I thought it would be helpful to give a bit of an update of what exactly
I think I've achieved over the last week or so.</p>
<p><strong>Learning with Texts</strong><br />
The majority of work I did this week involved translating the texts
which I current have imported into the Learning With Texts (LWT) feature
which is hosted at <a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/lwt/">Fluent In Three
Months</a>.  I've found LWT an
incredibly useful tool for learning words and phrases since the
<em>context</em> is continually stressed - words exists as part of  "real life"
sentences.   In terms of the content that I have placed with LWT, most
of what I have added is from <a href="http://lingoschmingo.com/2011/11/02/learning-with-deutsche-welle-news/" title="Learning with Deutsche Welle News">Deutsche Welle spoken
news</a>,
each item of which is roughly five minutes in length.  These news items
work very well for me due to the fact that they exist as audio items
with a corresponding transcript - my style of learning (as far as I'm
presently aware) is much more attuned to <em>listening</em>. I have to make
more of an effort to read, so anything which exists as <em>both</em> forms is a
real help in my efforts to expand my learning options. Having the audio
also helps since my intention is to play back these audio items in the
future just to check just how well I have <em>really</em> learned all the
items. Once I can understand the majority of the audio then I'll <em>know</em>
I've made progress.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing using Anki</strong><br />
Adding all of these items is all well and good but will amount to
nothing unless I can commit them all to memory.  To quote from its
website, "<a href="http://ankisrs.net/" title="Anki">Anki is a program which makes learning things
easy</a>".  Just what I need.  And it's free.
Bonus.  I've had nothing but good experiences with it so far and am
going to continue using this to start getting all of this new language
committed to memory.</p>
<p><strong>Some stats</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Anki - words and phrases in system: 630.  This constitutes stuff I
    really don't know right now - most of the words I <em>already</em> know
    aren't actually being added to Anki.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Problems encountered</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>"Dryness"</strong>. The problem with having news articles as the main
    focus of my learning was that I've it all found it a bit <em>dry</em>.  It
    probably doesn't help that the majority of the news over the last
    week (at least from the focus of the German media) has been focused
    on the slow death of the Euro - it's all rather depressing.  Perhaps
    I'm being a tad naïve, but I think my willingness to learn would be
    enhanced if I was able to be enthused by the subject matter.</li>
<li><strong>Repetition</strong>.  It has been a bit monotonous translating words and
    phrases within LWT.  Can get a bit repetitive.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Plan for the coming week</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continue to translate items within LWT and get the
    vocabulary/phrases across into Anki</li>
<li>Start a German book.</li>
<li>Watch more German TV.  I have the box set of
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromberg_%28TV_series%29">Stromberg</a>
    here, all waiting to be watched.It would be great if I could find
    some (German) subtitles, though - a lot of the idioms are a bit over
    my head which detracts from the <em>flow</em> somewhat.</li>
<li>Get a bit more <em>excitement</em> into LWT.  Deutsche Welle seem to have a
    lot more <em>human interest</em> items on their website - I'll focus on
    these a bit more.</li>
</ol>
