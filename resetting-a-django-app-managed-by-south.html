The project is still in the early phases of development and I have the luxury of being able to be fairly destructive when it comes to dropping models and repopulating data etc.</p><p>Before too long, however, I'll have to start doing some deployment for client approval, so I already have the app I'm working on hooked up to <a href="http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/part1.html">South</a> as a way of controlling schema and data migrations. I tend not to like using migrations too much in the early stages of development, purely because I'm potentially still 'playing around' at this stage, rather than committing planned changes.</p><p>Now that I'm hooked into using South, simply dropping things and starting again is a little more involved. What this post does is explain how I drop an app which uses South and recreate again. For this example, I'll assume that I'm working on an app called <code>blog</code> using a postgres database called <code>website_db</code>.</p><ol><li>First of all, I reset the migrations for the <code>blog</code> app to zero: <code>./manage.py migrate blog zero</code> What this does is remove any reference to the <code>blog</code> app from the south migration database table, forcing an migration to look into the files within the migrations folder in my <code>blog</code> app.</li><li>Now I drop any database tables referred to by the blog app by piping the sqlclear command to the psql command: <code>./manage.py sqlclear blog | psql website_db</code>. This physically drops all database tables related to this app. <em>Warning: all your data will be lost when you do this!</em></li><li>The next steps is to entirely remove the migrations folder from the <code>blog</code> app to prepare the way for refreshing things in the next step: <code>rm -rf blog/migrations/</code>. We are now effectively back at a 'blank page' with regards to this app.</li><li>To hook the app back up again to South, I now convert the blog app to South (any changes to the schema etc. would ideally be done before this stage. I convert my app to South by running: <code>./manage.py convert_to_south blog</code>. This command builds the schema migration into the <code>blog/migrations</code> folder.</li><li>Now I run the migration: <code>./manage.py migrate blog</code>.</li></ol><p>Obviously, there is now no data in this app so my next step is run a data population script. I'll outline the way I do this in a future post.</p><p>I know that nothing of what I've written above is new in any way; I thought it would simply be useful to lay out my process in a clear way. Hopefully it may help someone out.</p></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="textwidget"><a alt="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/niceguydave"><img src="./theme/button/badge_twitter.png" alt="twitter button"></a><a alt="Google +" rel="author" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidTalbot1974"><img src="./theme/button/badge_google+.png" alt="google + button"></a></div></div></body></html>
