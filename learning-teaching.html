</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Just back from a fantastic week in Hamburg and Berlin - Christmas with
my wife's family.  In terms of seeing how my German language learning is
progressing it was a <em>massive</em> confidence boost - I was able to sit
within groups of native speakers without anyone offering to speak in
English, understanding the vast majority of what was being talked
about..  The last time I spent a long weekend in Germany I felt
exhausted by the end of the day, I imagine from the effort needed to
concentrate on what was being said.  This time it was quite the opposite
- I felt as if I could understand the vast majority of what was being
talked about and  have much more of an ability to add my views and
direct conversation the way I would do in English.</p>
<p>One thing which this trip has really brought home to me is <em>just how
much</em> my German has improved since I've been sticking to a self-directed
system of learning.  My sister-in-law's partner is currently trying to
learn English and I mentioned to him that I'd be documenting the way in
which I learn so that he could try and apply this to his learning
efforts.  I've condensed my thoughts about this conversation into a a
new page, <a href="http://lingoschmingo.com/how-i-learn/" title="How I learn">How I
learn</a>, which
roughly sketches out my learning style.  There's no doubt the potential
to expand on this but for the moment at least something is there as a
foundation.</p>
<p>One thing that's not so clear to me is whether this information is going
to be of help to someone starting out with a new language - a lot of my
observations are based upon my perspective with German. I can't pretend
to know how to teach but would love to learn - if you happen to be
someone starting out with learning a new language, does this make sense?
Am I missing anything blindingly obvious? I'd love to hear your
thoughts.</p>
