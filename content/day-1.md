Taking a cue from Clarence at [The Fine Apps](http://thefineapps.com/),
I'm going to start keeping a log of my German work.  I've not started
using a
[chain](http://lifehacker.com/5443908/dont-break-the-chain-tracks-your-progress-seinfeld+style-in-chrome) method or
anything at this point, although I'm guessing it would be worth the
while.   Will investigate.

Anyway, here's what I did this evening.

</div>
1.  Started to translate LWT article, "[Was mich vom Glauben abhält,
    sind seine Reden](http://www.zeit.de/2011/41/Martenstein)"
2.  Did daily Anki review

**Notes**

</div>
<div>
I've already placed about ten articles within LWT. I'm using the [LWT
implementation used at Fluent in 3
Months](http://www.fluentin3months.com/lwt "Learning with Texts").
 Finding it incredibly useful. Thanks Benny :).) I tend to place items
in here as soon as I see something which interests me.  Problem is,
there's quite a bit of a backlog of stuff in there, all of which needs
reviewing.  I still have work to do in getting words and phrases
translated before importing into
