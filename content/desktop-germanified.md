I use Ubuntu at work and at home - I've had no excuse *not* to do this
so, first thing this morning, both environments were flipped over to
German.  *Abgemacht, so zu sagen*.  All I have to do now is work out how
the hell to find things I use all the time.  And God forbid the sysadmin
has to ever do anything to my machine in future ;)
