<p>It's been a difficult three weeks in terms of focussing on German.  My
father died suddenly and unexpectedly.  This obviously
threw <em>everything</em> into turmoil, not just my German learning. Not an
easy time to focus on anything, to be honest.</p>
<p>Still... I'm back at work now, which has brought a bit more rhythm back
into my daily life.  More than this, I'm starting to develop a morning
habit of doing my SRS reviews: LWT, sentences and computer terms (I've
switched my computer interface to German at home and work).</p>
<p><strong>Problems encountered</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Distractions</strong>. See above.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of a goal</strong>.  Still an issue I haven't dealt with.  I'm
    pretty sure I could pass the Goethe B2 exam so the C1 exam would be
    more of a challenge.  Plus, if I book it, the fact that I would be
    wasting money if I didn't study properly would be a good incentive
    to focus.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Discoveries</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>"Easy" books</strong>. I've started reading "<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallo,_Mister_Gott,_hier_spricht_Anna">Hallo, Mr Gott, hier
    spricht
    Anna.</a>"
    (Reading the Wikipedia entry I just realised that the book is set in
    the East End of London, where I currently live!)  What I've found
    whilst reading this book is that I understand enough of the text to
    allow for a <em>flow</em> whilst reading.  This really gives me a lot of
    self-confidence and makes it much easier to tolerate any feelings of
    being stuck when I talk with people or try and read the <a href="http://www.sueddeutsche.de/">Süddeutsche
    Zeitung</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Revisiting LWT audio items.</strong> This is something I realised this
    morning on the way into work.  There are a few Deutsche Welle news
    mp3 files on my phone.  These are all over a month old now but the
    text within them is what I've been using with my LWT lessons.  I
    found it interesting to realise that even though I may have
    remembered the meaning within my SRS tests, when I hear the same
    words <em>spoken in context</em> that I don't necessarily remember the
    meaning of the words.  This makes me feel that a combination of
    doing my daily tests and listening to the same texts could help to
    reinforce the meanings</li>
<li><strong>Speaking "Zeitungsdeutsch" to my wife.</strong> This made me laugh.  I
    use the phrase "meines Erachtens" whilst talking to my wife this
    morning.  She mentioned that I sounded like a newspaper.  Brilliant.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Plan for the coming week</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Continue to translate items within LWT and get the
    vocabulary/phrases across into Anki</li>
<li>Continue with German book "<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallo,_Mister_Gott,_hier_spricht_Anna">Hallo, Mr Gott, hier spricht
    Anna.</a>"</li>
<li>Download requirements for <a href="http://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/gc1/enindex.htm">Goethe C1
    exam</a>.  Begin
    assessing what I need to learn.</li>
</ol>
