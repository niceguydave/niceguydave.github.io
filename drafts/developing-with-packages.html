A couple of examples I've come across over the last few months</p><ul><li>Storage of media is always assumed to be local i.e. uploading to, say, S3 isn't taken into account</li><li>There's a bug in the version of a package I'm using. A fix has been merged into the latest release of the package but not into the branch I'm forced to use because of other dependencies.</li></ul><p>Although it makes sense to stick to using <code>pip</code> version, sometimes it's just not possible and I have to fork the project to make changes.</p><h2>Making local changes to this package</h2><p>Let's start with a simple example. One of the fields I want to use in a package I'm working with only lets me store 200 characters in a URL field - I would like to store 300. The standard procedure here would be to trigger a schema migration and then apply this. If I want this change to be picked up by my package, though and to push this change back up to the project source, how should I do this? The code is stored somewhere in my virtual environment and is sand-boxed from being modified</p></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="textwidget"><a alt="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/niceguydave"><img src="../theme/button/badge_twitter.png" alt="twitter button"></a><a alt="Google +" rel="author" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidTalbot1974"><img src="../theme/button/badge_google+.png" alt="google + button"></a></div></div></body></html>
