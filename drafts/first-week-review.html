I have to make more of an effort to read, so anything which exists as <em>both</em> forms is a real help in my efforts to expand my learning options. Having the audio also helps since my intention is to play back these audio items in the future just to check just how well I have <em>really</em> learned all the items. Once I can understand the majority of the audio then I'll <em>know</em> I've made progress.</p><p><strong>Reviewing using Anki</strong><br> Adding all of these items is all well and good but will amount to nothing unless I can commit them all to memory.  To quote from its website, "<a href="http://ankisrs.net/" title="Anki">Anki is a program which makes learning things easy</a>".  Just what I need.  And it's free. Bonus.  I've had nothing but good experiences with it so far and am going to continue using this to start getting all of this new language committed to memory.</p><p><strong>Some stats</strong></p><ol><li>Anki - words and phrases in system: 630.  This constitutes stuff I really don't know right now - most of the words I <em>already</em> know aren't actually being added to Anki.</li></ol><p><strong>Problems encountered</strong></p><ol><li><strong>"Dryness"</strong>. The problem with having news articles as the main focus of my learning was that I've it all found it a bit <em>dry</em>.  It probably doesn't help that the majority of the news over the last week (at least from the focus of the German media) has been focused on the slow death of the Euro - it's all rather depressing.  Perhaps I'm being a tad naïve, but I think my willingness to learn would be enhanced if I was able to be enthused by the subject matter.</li><li><strong>Repetition</strong>.  It has been a bit monotonous translating words and phrases within LWT.  Can get a bit repetitive.</li></ol><p><strong>Plan for the coming week</strong></p><ol><li>Continue to translate items within LWT and get the vocabulary/phrases across into Anki</li><li>Start a German book.</li><li>Watch more German TV.  I have the box set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromberg_%28TV_series%29">Stromberg</a> here, all waiting to be watched.It would be great if I could find some (German) subtitles, though - a lot of the idioms are a bit over my head which detracts from the <em>flow</em> somewhat.</li><li>Get a bit more <em>excitement</em> into LWT.  Deutsche Welle seem to have a lot more <em>human interest</em> items on their website - I'll focus on these a bit more.</li></ol></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="textwidget"><a alt="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/niceguydave"><img src="../theme/button/badge_twitter.png" alt="twitter button"></a><a alt="Google +" rel="author" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+DavidTalbot1974"><img src="../theme/button/badge_google+.png" alt="google + button"></a></div></div></body></html>
