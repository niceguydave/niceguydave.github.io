I'm responsible for - I wasn't expecting this to happen when writing the 
schema so I thought it worthwhile adding here in the event that it helps
anyone else who may be in the same situation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenario was adding an optional field to to a Django &lt;a href="http://django-filer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/usage.html#filerfilefield-and-filerimagefield"&gt;FilerImageField&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simplification of my model is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;filer.fields.image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FilerImageField&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CharField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;max_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;      
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FilerImageField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="n"&gt;help_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Image should be at least 200 x 100px.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My initial thoughts on this were, "it's an optional field so it shouldn't 
matter whether the &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; instance referred to is deleted from the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deleting anything, the default behaviour of any foreign keys 
&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete"&gt;emulates the behavior of the SQL constraint ON DELETE 
CASCADE&lt;/a&gt;, 
which is to say, even though an &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; exists in an instance of &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt;, 
and is optional, the fact that it has a foreign key relationship to the
&lt;code&gt;FilerImageField&lt;/code&gt; instance means that the &lt;code&gt;Foo&lt;/code&gt; instance will, be default,
 be deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve this issue, in my case, I changed the &lt;code&gt;on_delete&lt;/code&gt; attribute for my
&lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; field to set the value of &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; to be
&lt;a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.SET_NULL"&gt;NULL&lt;/a&gt; in the event that the 
connected &lt;code&gt;FilerFieldImage&lt;/code&gt; field were deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code therefore was rewritten to look as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;filer.fields.image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FilerImageField&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CharField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;max_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;      
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FilerImageField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;blank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="n"&gt;help_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Image should be at least 200 x 100px.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="n"&gt;on_delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SET_NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

adjectives.  In conversation, I tend to just rush through things without
worrying too much about grammatical accuracy but if I want to improve my
written language it's going to be pretty vital to find a quick way of
getting things right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any search for "German adjective endings" will take you to a number
of different sites explaining how every permutation of gender, case and
article combines to give you the ending you're looking for.  There
are 48 different permutations; trying to glean the correct choice by
mentally trying to recall the image of a table of this data in my head
just isn't effective.  It's an effort to recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this changed after following one of the points in a book I bought
by Judith Meyer: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FN2Y8XK/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_lc?tag=sprachprofi-20&amp;amp;camp=14573&amp;amp;creative=327641&amp;amp;linkCode=as1&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00FN2Y8XK&amp;amp;adid=0NV772QS1TDR01RMSP78&amp;amp;&amp;amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.learnlangs.com%2F72_ways"&gt;72 Ways to Learn German for
Free&lt;/a&gt;.
 She directed me to a &lt;a href="http://www.nthuleen.com/teach/grammar/adjektivendungenexpl.html"&gt;four-step process
illustrated&lt;/a&gt;
by Nancy Thuleen which quickly gets me to the ending I need; far quicker
than the abstract declension table I've been mentally schlepping around
for the last six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of the sites above are great resources for learning German, too.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="adjectives"></category><category term="german"></category><category term="grammar"></category></entry><entry><title>Resetting a Django app managed by South</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/resetting-a-django-app-managed-by-south.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-10-04T10:40:00+01:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2014-10-04:resetting-a-django-app-managed-by-south.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm currently working on a Django 1.6 project. The project is still in
the early phases of development and I have the luxury of being able to
be fairly destructive when it comes to dropping models and repopulating
data etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before too long, however, I'll have to start doing some deployment for
client approval, so I already have the app I'm working on hooked up to
&lt;a href="http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/part1.html"&gt;South&lt;/a&gt; as a
way of controlling schema and data migrations. I tend not to like using
migrations too much in the early stages of development, purely because
I'm potentially still 'playing around' at this stage, rather than
committing planned changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm hooked into using South, simply dropping things and
starting again is a little more involved. What this post does is explain
how I drop an app which uses South and recreate again. For this example,
I'll assume that I'm working on an app called &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; using a postgres
database called &lt;code&gt;website_db&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all, I reset the migrations for the &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; app to zero:
    &lt;code&gt;./manage.py migrate blog zero&lt;/code&gt; What this does is remove any
    reference to the &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; app from the south migration database table,
    forcing an migration to look into the files within the migrations
    folder in my &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now I drop any database tables referred to by the blog app by piping
    the sqlclear command to the psql command:
    &lt;code&gt;./manage.py sqlclear blog | psql website_db&lt;/code&gt;. This physically drops
    all database tables related to this app. &lt;em&gt;Warning: all your data
    will be lost when you do this!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next steps is to entirely remove the migrations folder from the
    &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; app to prepare the way for refreshing things in the next
    step: &lt;code&gt;rm -rf blog/migrations/&lt;/code&gt;. We are now effectively back at a
    'blank page' with regards to this app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To hook the app back up again to South, I now convert the blog app
    to South (any changes to the schema etc. would ideally be done
    before this stage. I convert my app to South by running:
    &lt;code&gt;./manage.py convert_to_south blog&lt;/code&gt;. This command builds the schema
    migration into the &lt;code&gt;blog/migrations&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now I run the migration: &lt;code&gt;./manage.py migrate blog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there is now no data in this app so my next step is run a
data population script. I'll outline the way I do this in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that nothing of what I've written above is new in any way; I
thought it would simply be useful to lay out my process in a clear way.
Hopefully it may help someone out.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="django"></category><category term="south"></category></entry><entry><title>Enabling native spell checking with Django-CMS 3</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/enabling-native-spell-checking-with-django-cms-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-09-22T11:54:00+01:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2014-09-22:enabling-native-spell-checking-with-django-cms-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We use Django-CMS extensively at the company I work for,
&lt;a href="http://www.pancentric.com/"&gt;Pancentric&lt;/a&gt;. I was recently
given what, at first, seemed to be a fairly simple request: ensure that
any misspelled words are highlighted within the default text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm fairly new to &lt;a href="http://ckeditor.com/" title="CKEditor"&gt;CKEditor&lt;/a&gt; and
although I'm liking using it so far, there are a certain number of
features which make things... awkward. Spell checking is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toolbar has a number of sensible defaults which can be seen in the
image below.  Notice that, although the last three words are misspelled,
there is no visual indication of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Default CKEditor layout" src="images/django_cms_toolbar_pre_config.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that what I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have here is either a spell-check
button or the ability to see any misspelled words highlighted within the
text editor itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After digging around for a while, it seemed that many of the
recommendations for including a spell checker directed me to using a
licensed plugin, something which I didn't want or need; I just wanted to
enable the context menu to highlight misspelled words. Moreover, the
context menu had been hijacked too, which stopped me from right-clicking
on a word to get a context-specific menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, after a bit of searching and finding some useful posts about
the same issue (like &lt;a href="http://murfitt.net/blog/getting-browser-spell-checker-work-ckeditor-drupal"&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2682042/ckeditor-using-firefox-built-in-spellchecker"&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt;)
I was able to hack together the following configuration. This sits
within my &lt;code&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt; file and gives a minimal working solution which
allows misspelled words to be highlighted within the text editor and
which doesn't force me to install any additional spell checking plugins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;CKEDITOR_SETTINGS = {  
    &amp;#39;disableNativeSpellChecker&amp;#39;: False,  
    &amp;#39;removePlugins&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;contextmenu,liststyle,tabletools&amp;#39;,  
    &amp;#39;toolbar_CMS&amp;#39;: [  
        [&amp;#39;Undo&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Redo&amp;#39;],  
        [&amp;#39;cmsplugins&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;-&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;PasteText&amp;#39;,],  
        [&amp;#39;Format&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;NumberedList&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;BulletedList&amp;#39;,],  
        [&amp;#39;Bold&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Italic&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Underline&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;-&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;RemoveFormat&amp;#39;],  
        [&amp;#39;Source&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ShowBlocks&amp;#39;,]  
    ],  
}  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some notes on what I've done here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, &lt;a href="http://docs.ckeditor.com/#!/guide/dev_spellcheck"&gt;&lt;code&gt;disableNativeSpellChecker&lt;/code&gt; is set to
    &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so I
    needed to override this behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only actually needed to remove &lt;code&gt;contextmenu&lt;/code&gt; from the
    &lt;code&gt;removePlugins&lt;/code&gt; attribute: &lt;code&gt;liststyle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tabletools&lt;/code&gt; depend upon
    &lt;code&gt;contextmenu&lt;/code&gt;, so they needed to come out, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The additional &lt;code&gt;'toolbar_CMS'&lt;/code&gt; config is not part of the problem
    above but illustrates how I've reduced the number of tool bar items
    to a sensible minimum in the image below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final appearance of the editor after the changes have been made is
as below.  Notice the final three nonsense words highlighted as
misspelled (I'm using Chrome ):&lt;/p&gt;

Django model methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overview: I recently found myself in a situation where I needed to
ensure that the &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt; field on a model was unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simplification of the model is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CharField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;\&lt;span class="n"&gt;_length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SlugField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unique&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In terms of how to test this change to the model, my initial thoughts
were that things should be fairly simple: create an object with a
specific &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt; and then create another object with the same &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt;,
expecting an &lt;code&gt;IntegrityError&lt;/code&gt; to be raised. As such, my approach was to
write the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;IntegrityError&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;django.test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TestCase&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;.models&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;FooModelTest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;TestCase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;test_unique_slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;A slug should be unique.  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Foo1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;foo1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;f1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;f2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Foo2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;foo1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;assertRaises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IntegrityError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;f2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;save&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, rather than checking that the &lt;code&gt;IntegrityError&lt;/code&gt; was being raised
was being raised, the &lt;code&gt;IntegrityError&lt;/code&gt; was called before the test could
run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What had happened was that, rather than passing the &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt; method itself
to &lt;code&gt;self.assertRaises&lt;/code&gt; I was calling &lt;code&gt;save()&lt;/code&gt; directly: an
&lt;code&gt;IntegrityError&lt;/code&gt; was being raised before the test had even been run,
rather than having the test itself check the &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt; method in the
assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this, I removed the parentheses from &lt;code&gt;f2.save()&lt;/code&gt; i.e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;...  
self.assertRaises(IntegrityError, f2.save)  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;then everything works exactly as expected.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="django"></category><category term="testing"></category></entry><entry><title>My definition of working knowledge of a language</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/working-knowledge.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-30T09:05:00+00:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2011-12-30:working-knowledge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago I was sat in a restaurant in Berlin in the midst of
an enjoyable German conversation, able to understand enough of what was
being said to make me realise that I'd reached a very important goal -
my German had reached a level where I was &lt;em&gt;enjoying&lt;/em&gt; it. Up until this
point, after spending a few days in Germany I would generally retreat to
my bed by 9pm or so, mentally exhausted.  This didn't happen this time -
I could quite happily have sat at that table until 2am, loving the fact
that I'd suddenly discovered all of these new insights into other
people's realities.  I was following it all sharply, intently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This level of competence seems to me to be a good goal to aspire to when
I begin my next language.  I would like to be able to sit comfortably in
conversation with people, with enough competence to be able to hold onto
the thread of the conversation without becoming mentally overloaded by
the effort.  I've not wanted to give up on learning German too early so
far because I think the language deserved a good amount of my focus -
some respect.  Before I finish entirely with devoting all my time to
German I'm going to get a video of myself up on YouTube speaking the
language just to "seal the deal" as it were - see how native German
speakers find my attempts - keep your eyes peeled.  Although I'm not
going to (and don't want to) give up on German after this I've crossed a
line now which I think allows me to start thinking about new
adventures...&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>Learning, teaching.</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/learning-teaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-29T14:14:00+00:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2011-12-29:learning-teaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just back from a fantastic week in Hamburg and Berlin - Christmas with
my wife's family.  In terms of seeing how my German language learning is
progressing it was a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; confidence boost - I was able to sit
within groups of native speakers without anyone offering to speak in
English, understanding the vast majority of what was being talked
about..  The last time I spent a long weekend in Germany I felt
exhausted by the end of the day, I imagine from the effort needed to
concentrate on what was being said.  This time it was quite the opposite
- I felt as if I could understand the vast majority of what was being
talked about and  have much more of an ability to add my views and
direct conversation the way I would do in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing which this trip has really brought home to me is &lt;em&gt;just how
much&lt;/em&gt; my German has improved since I've been sticking to a self-directed
system of learning.  My sister-in-law's partner is currently trying to
learn English and I mentioned to him that I'd be documenting the way in
which I learn so that he could try and apply this to his learning
efforts.  I've condensed my thoughts about this conversation into a a
new page, &lt;a href="http://lingoschmingo.com/how-i-learn/" title="How I learn"&gt;How I
learn&lt;/a&gt;, which
roughly sketches out my learning style.  There's no doubt the potential
to expand on this but for the moment at least something is there as a
foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that's not so clear to me is whether this information is going
to be of help to someone starting out with a new language - a lot of my
observations are based upon my perspective with German. I can't pretend
to know how to teach but would love to learn - if you happen to be
someone starting out with learning a new language, does this make sense?
Am I missing anything blindingly obvious? I'd love to hear your
thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="learning"></category><category term="teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>How I learn languages</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/how-i-learn-languages.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-29T13:41:00+00:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2011-12-29:how-i-learn-languages.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My current language learning system can be broken down into the
following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#lwt"&gt;Adding information to
    &lt;abbr title="Learning With Texts"&gt;LWT&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#sample_sentences"&gt;Creating useful sample sentences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#anki"&gt;Reviewing with memorising software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#speaking"&gt;Finding as much time as possible to talk in my target
    language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#reading"&gt;Reading "easy" books&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LWT (Learning With Texts)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://lwt.sourceforge.net/" title="Learning With Texts"&gt;Learning With
Texts&lt;/a&gt; project allows
you to add your own text and audio with the intention of gradually
building up a store of vocabulary and phrases which are then learned
over time.  &lt;a href="http://lingoschmingo.com/2011/11/13/first-week-review/" title="First week: review"&gt;I posted a brief comment about the LWT
project&lt;/a&gt;
when I first started this blog. I'm still adding Deutsche Welle news
items to the system, mainly because I find the combination of audio of
transcripts so useful.  Furthermore, the news readers have very good
voices - it's enjoyable listening to them talk!  In addition to the news
items, I'm starting to add transcripts of books that I'm reading - see
more about this in the &lt;a href="#reading"&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; section below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating sentences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the nitty-gritty of using a language "in the wild",
just knowing "news German" isn't going to cut it.  You're going to need
"day-to-day" language to catch a bus, buy a beer, ask someone out.
 There are mainly two types of sentences that I create:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult words from LWT&lt;/strong&gt; - it often happens that words or
    phrases which I trying to learn from my LWT just don't sink in to my
    memory.  In this case, I try and find a simple sentence (or two)
    containing this language element and add this to my&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful sentences&lt;/strong&gt; - these kinds of sentences are by far the most
    important.  Depending on your level of understanding of your target
    language these kind of sentences could be anything from "could you
    tell me the time, please?" to "If I were you, I wouldn't have said
    that" etc.  Paradoxically, at least in my experience, I find these
    are also the hardest to gather, since they tend to pop up in the
    middle of conversation with someone i.e. I find myself trying to
    express myself  and find that the word aren't there.  I've tried
    carrying a dictaphone around to try and talk into when the moment
    occurs but, to he honest, I feel like a bit of an idiot talking into
    the thing.  It also tends to kill the flow of an otherwise
    conversation! (anyone with any tips on how to capture these moments&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;please let me know your thoughts!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remembering things with an &lt;abbr title="Spaced Repetition System"&gt;SRS&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition_system"&gt;Spaced Repetition
Systems&lt;/a&gt; (SRS)
make it easier to remember things. I happen to have found
&lt;a href="http://ankisrs.net/" title="Anki"&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt; to work really well for me, so this
is the application which I use for adding new sentences, aphorisms and
&lt;a href="http://www.livinginthemiddlekingdom.com/2011/09/26/how-to-export-learning-with-texts-terms-to-anki-the-easy-way/"&gt;cloze tests extracted from
LWT&lt;/a&gt;.
 The thing about using an SRS is this - &lt;em&gt;you have to use it&lt;/em&gt;.  I happen
to have gotten into a daily habit of sitting down with a cup of coffee
first thing in the morning for half an hour and running through my
reviews  - this has made a &lt;em&gt;massive&lt;/em&gt; difference to my ability to recall
words and use them in conversation.  I'd say it's made the single
biggest difference to my learning.  This, in turn, inspires me to sit
down every morning and keep on doing my reviews: a virtuous circle, so
to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I synchronise the Anki desktop app with a live server which means that
I'm always able to access the information no matter where I am.  As soon
as I have a page about my specific set-up I'll post a link to it from
here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speaking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I happen to be lucky enough to have a German wife, which is a massive
help when it comes to learning German: there's never any excuse for
me &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to practise with her.  More than this, though, I find it vital
to be within a group of native speakers.  The reason behind this is that
I'm more likely to be exposed to &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; language than when I'm with
my wife - perhaps because Tina unconsciously tones down her language to
ensure that I'm able to follow along.  Granted, I may not always be
directing the flow of conversation as I may be in English but it's a
massive confidence boost to be in groups of native speakers of your
target language and being able to understand more and more of what is
being talked about.  This is something which really inspires me - being
able to understand just a little bit more every time I meet up with
native speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of my wife's circle of family and
friends, &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/"&gt;Meetup&lt;/a&gt; has worked best for me in
terms of finding groups of people to speak with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading, as opposed to putting texts with my &lt;a href="#lwt"&gt;LWT&lt;/a&gt; system, is
something I enjoy best when there is a certain &lt;em&gt;flow&lt;/em&gt; to thing.  I'm
able to generate this flow with German now by reading books at the
language level &lt;em&gt;just a bit&lt;/em&gt; above my current understanding level - that
is to say, If I don't know a word, I can often glean the meaning from
the context but I don't stop to look up the word in a dictionary.  I
find it uncomfortable having a mental hand-brake slowing things down.
 In addition, and if possible, I read books which have PDF versions and
 put the text of the PDF into my &lt;a href="#lwt"&gt;LWT&lt;/a&gt; system.  This ensure that I
can mop up any words or phrases which I may have missed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Unplugged language learning</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/unplugged-language-learning.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-20T21:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2011-12-20:unplugged-language-learning.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm off tomorrow to spend Christmas in Hamburg and Berlin, which will
mean a week of not being plugged in to the various digital
&lt;em&gt;accoutrements&lt;/em&gt; which I've so busily been tethering myself to over the
last few weeks.  I thought it worth the while to fire up a post about my
approach to continuing to learn without the internet, even whilst living
in a country which uses my target language (German).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podcasts
&lt;/strong&gt;I've got an mp3 player which I'm going to bring along with me - I've
stacked it full of podcasts that I've found whilst doing a general trawl
of the internet today.  To be honest, I think this is going to be
overkill - I'll be immersed for a whole week so it's fairly unlikely
that I'll be wanting to retreat to &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; German when I have a
break.  Who knows - perhaps I'll use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing uncle&lt;/strong&gt;
I've managed to find myself with &lt;em&gt;seven&lt;/em&gt; German nephews and nieces
since marrying Tina.  Hanging out with them for a while makes it easier
to take a break from trying to convince the grown ups that I can speak
their language.  I'm also pretty lucky that the kids are more than
willing to point out my shortcomings when I make a mess of their
language ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictaphone&lt;/strong&gt;
A while back, I started trying to record myself telling stories to Tina
with the intention of going back over them at some future point and
seeing (hopefully!) how far I'd progressed.  I think this could also
come in useful in Germany - recording conversations that I'm having
whilst I'm over there.  I'm hoping that  at the very least this will
allow me to go back over what is useful &lt;em&gt;spoken&lt;/em&gt; language - much of my
focus at the moment is on understanding &lt;em&gt;written&lt;/em&gt; German, I think, to
the detriment of my spoken German.   Another good use of the dictaphone
could be to use it to take notes of phrases I don't understand on the
fly, rather then having to use pen and paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we'll see.  I'm really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="children"></category><category term="dictaphone"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="recording"></category></entry><entry><title>Getting behind</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/getting-behind.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-07T07:28:00+00:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2011-12-07:getting-behind.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been difficult to keep up with a lot of my German practice lately -
I've had a family crisis which has taken up most of my time over the
last ten days.  As soon as I woke up this morning, though, I got Anki
opened up and started going through the backlog of repetitions awaiting
me.  It was somewhat reassuring to see many items had actually stuck in
my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is really a bit of an affirmation to myself that, no matter
what pressing issues face me along the way, my German will always be
patiently waiting for me when I come back to it.  More than that, I
think it may be a good thing for me to take my mind off my troubles - a
therapy of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Telling stories</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/telling_stories.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-22T13:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2011-11-22:telling_stories.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My (German) wife came back yesterday after ten days away travelling with
work.  Naturally we spent a fair bit of time catching up with what had
been happening in each other's lives.  When it came to my turn to talk
about the week I'd had I thought I'd mention that I'd been reading
Rumpelstilzchen in German .  She asked me to recount how the story went
- it had been a while since she'd heard it.  So I tried to explain -
this is when it all got very interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rumpelstilzchen" src="images/rumpelstilzchen_b_n.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised that there are still &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of basic grammatical phrases
that I still can't use fluidly in such situations, an example being "so
he asked her what she had been doing" .  I was really struggling to find
my way a lot of the time.  In the end, though, I think I got my point
across but it was a bit of a wake-up call.  With a bit more fluency in
these kind of connecting phrases I feel that my spoken German would be a
lot better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of this situation: I've learnt that telling stories is a
great way for me to judge my current language ability.  Fairy tales, my
day at work, general chitchat.  I'd also like to dig out the digital
dictaphone I have hanging around and record these situations - will be a
good way to work out where I'm finding problems.  It will be equally
good to find out the places where things are going well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="grammar"></category><category term="stories"></category></entry><entry><title>Desktop: germanified</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/desktop-germanified.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-21T11:24:00+00:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2011-11-21:desktop-germanified.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use Ubuntu at work and at home - I've had no excuse &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do this

have a bit of a look around the web for some language resources which
could help me along the way.  I had some nice feedback from Clarence at
&lt;a href="http://thefineapps.com/2011/09/21/general-language-learning-tips/" title="General Language Learning Tips"&gt;TheFineApps&lt;/a&gt;,
pointing me towards some observations that he's been able to make on the
language learning path.  Trying out new, fun ways of learning is
something I can't disagree with - the more it feels like hard work the
less likely I am to stick to it.  So I had a bit of a look around.  Once
I'd found &lt;a href="http://lang-8.com/"&gt;Lang-8&lt;/a&gt; I stopped looking - this looks to
me like it could be a great place to improve my written language, as
well as helping other people out. From what I can tell, this is a place
where it's possible to post snippets in your target language and hope
that people will be able to post comments and corrections.  Since most
of the post here are in English I thought I'd help do some correcting.
 What I found interesting about this is that, having had no formal
languages teaching experience, I'm at a loss why we would say in English
"I am crossing the road" rather than "I am crossing *a* road".  It's
given me plenty of food for thought.  Written German isn't my strong
point so I'll be looking to use this site more and more to help me gain
more confidence.  I've posted a cursory couple of paragraphs about a
&lt;a href="http://lang-8.com/326400/journals"&gt;trip I made to The British Museum&lt;/a&gt;
yesterday.  All done off the top of my head so no checking for adjective
declination and cases etc. (this probably says &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; about my approach
to the finer points of language learning!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also aware that the only way I'm going to progress is to start doing
a little bit every day and ensure that I keep things moving slowly but
surely.  I think Clarence's daily posting log is a really good idea -
from my experience it's much easier to keep moving forward when I can
see where I've come from.  I'll probably do something similar, although
not post these to Twitter or Facebook for these "check in" tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Lang-8"></category><category term="teaching"></category></entry><entry><title>Learning with Deutsche Welle News</title><link href="http://niceguydave.com/learning-with-deutsche-welle-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-02T12:40:00+00:00</updated><author><name>niceguydave</name></author><id>tag:niceguydave.com,2011-11-02:learning-with-deutsche-welle-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to learning new things, I'm all for keeping it short and

pieces of SRS software on my laptop at home, none of them really used
extensively.  I think the reason for my not being successful with these
is that I just don't grab &lt;em&gt;essential snippets&lt;/em&gt; of real language.  I
guess were I to have these essential snippets then I'd me more inclined
to want to remember things. Which leads on to the next point...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Start recording things&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;I've got a smart phone with a voice recorder on it and also a
dictaphone which is small enough to carry around.  &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; I remember to
use it, that is. That's the current problem: when I find myself lost for
words, I know then exactly what is important to learn but I generally
don't record what I need to say and bring it home to be logged and
memorised. To my mind, if I could set a goal of bringing back five
phrases a day to be written down and memorised I'd be well on the way to
improving my language level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
**3. Use less English at home  
**With reference to the opening paragraph: the reason I speak any German
*at all* is because of my wife.  It seemed natural to me to want to
learn German when we met - how else could I *really* know about her and
her family and friends?  I think the problem is that since our default
language is English, this is the language that we always revert to if it
gets tricky to communicate a point.  So I'm not really having to do the
hard work of learning how to communicate difficult issues.    In terms
of practicalities, though, this isn't always the easiest one.  When
something has to be said urgently the last thing either of us want is to
be grasping for the words.  Saying this, it has gotten better.  We
probably use German at home about 20% of the time.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Make sure I spend as much time as possible in small German-speaking
groups&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Just the other night, a German friend was visiting for dinner.  One of
the best things for me in terms of language learning in these moments is
that that I can hear German spoken in a closed environment (no external
distractions) and with a level of German that (can be) a step above my
comprehension.  There is enough comprehensible input for me to follow
along with what is going on but also enough novelty for me to take note
of what I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; know and need to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:small;"&gt;5. &lt;/span&gt;Getting along to a language
class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I tried this a few times last year and, to be honest, it didn't really
work for me.  I think the problem was that I'd gone for classes below my
level and I really wasn't challenged enough. Add to this that my current
disposable income is a bit low right now, I'd rather find other ways to
learn than being sat in a classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't an extensive list but should at least show what I think are
the some way forward for me at this point in time.  Do you think my list
is inclusive enough? Am I missing something obvious? Please let me know
